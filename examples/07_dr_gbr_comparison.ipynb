    "# DR vs GBR: Distributional Repair & Group-Blind Repair (Adult dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook compares two dataset-repair approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributional Repair (DR)** group-aware: learns two OT maps (S=0 and S=1) to a shared barycenter (conditional on U).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GroupBlind Repair (GBR)** group-blind: learns one OT map from the pooled distribution to a target (we will align this target with DRâ€™s barycenter so the comparison is meaningful). Variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `baseline` (no fairness vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `partial` / `total` (use fairness vector *V*), optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** Adult (AIF360).  \n",
    "**Protected (S):** sex (0 = Female, 1 = Male)  \n",
    "**Unprotected (U):** college_educated (0/1)  \n",
    "**Features (X):** age, hours-per-week (continuous)\n",
